WIC Hackathon Project for Our Team

Name of Program: HindSITE
Description of Program: A stock-market game with predictive analysis performed using Google Gemini. It's a rogue-like stock game where the player goes through a specific number of turns through various stock simulations. The user is given vague headlines from a news source that they must interpret in order to successfully predict the growth and decay of different stocks. There is multiple game modes in more quirky atmospheres, such as Medieval Times and Space, that allows for a more unique experience compared to other stock simulation games out there. It is a short-term game that moves ahead in time for each turn and the highest net worth by the end is the player's high score.
